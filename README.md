OMG, just watched Heart Eyes and I don’t even know where to start. Seriously, like, what did I even watch? One second I'm loving it, next I’m like “Wait, what?” 😂 This movie just messes with your brain, man. Like, did they really think that ending was a good idea?

I mean, first, the couple is all cute and everything, but then it’s like BAM, everything’s twisted. You know what I mean? Why do I even try to understand these movies? Like, am I the only one who thought the soundtrack was doing its own thing? Sometimes I wish there was a mute button for that. 😂

> And what's with the dialogue? It was either super deep or made zero sense at times, like they were trying too hard to sound cool or something. Honestly, I was kinda expecting more, especially after I went through all that trouble to download the movie. Talk about mixed emotions.

You know that feeling when a scene just seems off, but you can’t figure out why? Yeah, there were like a dozen of those moments. Maybe I'm just overthinking stuff, but whatever. Anyway, I'm gonna need to watch the movie again, just to see if I missed something, like a hidden Easter egg or whatever those movie nerds talk about.

definitely_the_best_line_ever = False  # Okay, this is just stuck in my head now haha

But hey, the visuals were something! Can’t lie about that. Wish my life had that kind of lighting. 😂 But yeah, I’m probably gonna rant about this more tomorrow, once I've slept. Let me know if you wanna download it and give it a go. I need someone to validate my confusion, LOL!
